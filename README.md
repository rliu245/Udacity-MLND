# Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity

### Install

The projects require **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Description
During the time I was taking the nanodegree from Udacity, I was assigned projects which were to be completed after every finished unit. In total, there were 6 projects and 1 final project. Overall, the MLND course from Udacity was a stepping stone for my entry into the Machine Learning field and I learned a large amount in a short amount of time. In this repo, I present the projects I have completed during my enrollment in Udacity's MLND program.
